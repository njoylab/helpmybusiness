description: "## What is this website?

Love Our Locals is a directory of any Local Business type that offer online gift cards/vouchers for purchase. In this difficult time caused by the COVID-19, many places must stay closed for their andour health, but their fixed costs stays. We want to help them out to make sure we will be able to enjoy those loved locations when our lifestyle will go back to normal. By purchasing a Gift Card for a future user, you will support you favourite locations now!

## Where did it start?

In the US there are already similar initiatives, as for example: https://saveourfaves.org/ . We thought to help out as well, with a global project starting from our hometown, Milan.

## Can i help?

Sure thing! Actually, this website has a real meaning if it is supported by the community. If one of your favourite places is not yet on our portal, look for the webpage link where it sells its voucher, and add it directly [here](../poi/add). Otherwise, if you want to help with the project, you find the [project here on github](https://github.com/njoylab/helpmybusiness).

## I am a Local Business Owner, can I be on your portal?

If you are already selling online voucher/Gift Cards, [add your Business here](../poi/add). If you don't support it yet, we are looking for a solution for you. [Complete this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaTOWhCVtAa641_-dnWr_9OJ-sfGK0QO7sF_MTioPZPD9RtA/viewform) and we will contact you as soon as possible.

In general we suggest to propose small cuts vouchers ( 20-30â‚¬), o maybe discounted. If your Business is not in emergency, we suggest to donate everything to hospitals or sanitary structures which at the moment are in need.

## I am a Local Business Owner, I don't want to be on your portal

If you want to be removed from our portal, just[write us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaTOWhCVtAa641_-dnWr_9OJ-sfGK0QO7sF_MTioPZPD9RtA/viewform). We are sorry to hear it didn't help you.

## How can I help more?

\"Stay at home\" ( cit.) and if possible order food delivery at least once a week. And if you wish to give a small tip to those who are bringing it to you, it's even nicer, it's a difficult time for them as well.

## Who are you?

Emiliano and Serena, and we are the founders of www.urbi.co
